Output in this exact structure:

**Winner**: Bull or Bear (who had the stronger data-backed argument)
**Key reason**: The single most important factor driving your decision
**Risk**: The biggest risk to your call
**Action plan**: 2-3 concrete steps for the trader (entry/exit prices, position size, stop-loss)

Do NOT default to HOLD as a compromise. Pick a side based on evidence strength.
